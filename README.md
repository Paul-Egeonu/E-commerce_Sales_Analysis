### Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset was explored to answer key questions such as:

2. How much sales were made by each payment type and what was their percentage contribution to total revenue?
3. What was the sales trend of payment types per month?
3. How was the performance of the service providers in terms of sales and number of purchases?
4. What is the forecast for the final quarter of the year? Is performance expected to climb or drop? Are there factors such as locality seasonal trend which are expected to affect sales?
5. Are there opportunities for growth in any payment category?
6. Should a customer loyalty program be initiated, are there customers with a record of repeated purchases?
7. What are the limitations to the analysis of this data?
